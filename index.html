                <h2> RISHI BHARADWAJ AKKIRAJU</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I am a passionate web developer.</p>
                <p>My journey in web development began several months ago, and since then, I've had the opportunity to work on various projects, collaborating with talented teams and clients to bring ideas to life. I believe in the power of teamwork, creativity, and continuous learning to achieve remarkable results.</p>
                <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new coding challenges, learning new programming languages, or enjoying the great outdoors. I'm passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems and am excited about the endless possibilities it offers.</p>
